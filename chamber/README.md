# chamber

A water chamber is required between MO2 and MO3 in the setup. This chamber is made of flexible sylgard material.
The attached stl file can be used to create the mold for casting sylgard in the chamber shape.

A clip can also be printed out of plastic material to go along the chamber.

Original blender files are also included for those who want to play with the dimensions to adapt it to their own application.
